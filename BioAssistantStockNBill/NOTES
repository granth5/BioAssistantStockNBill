* START:
- Use CoreData, preloaded from JSON
    - will use API calls to get SAME data later


OBJECTS:
- PatientInfo
- Insurance
- Doctor

- Item

- Order
- OrderItem


*** QUESTIONS ***
1 - ONLY new patient / order info?
    - static (for iPad) tables:
        - Doctors
        - Insurances
        - Items

Got the order list working, and start of edit screen, but running into multiple issues
learning CoreData / SwiftUI - got passing objects around pretty good, but got carried
away with passing CoreData controller everywhere, it was creating new / extra contexts
all the time.

SO - found good article from hackingwithswift.com on making a singleton struct to
hold the context and putting it in the environment

** 12/7/2023:
More problems getting CD to work - signed up to hackingwithswift.com, found more stuff
to try w/custom structs for the CD objects.

Starting to lean toward keeping the CD stuff in independent tables - no relationships.
Then make a custom data provider which reads the CD into object arrays - when anything's
needed, simply build the object / list to return.
